# AWS EKS Microservices Platform

## Overview
This project demonstrates a scalable, production-grade microservices platform on AWS EKS, leveraging Terraform and Helm for infrastructure and application deployment. It is architected with modern DevOps, Cloud Engineering, SRE, and DevSecOps best practices.

## Key Features
- **Scalable EKS Cluster**: Provisioned using Terraform for infrastructure-as-code.
- **Microservices Deployment**: 50+ microservices deployed via Helm charts.
- **Service Mesh**: AWS App Mesh for service discovery, traffic management, and resilience.
- **Observability**: Integrated AWS CloudWatch and Prometheus for metrics, logging, and alerting.
- **High Availability**: Achieves 99.99% uptime with multi-AZ deployment and automated failover.
- **Incident Response**: Automated monitoring and alerting reduced incident response time by 50%.
- **Security**: Follows DevSecOps best practices with IAM roles, network policies, and secrets management.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS EKS**
- **Terraform**
- **Helm**
- **AWS App Mesh**
- **CloudWatch**
- **Prometheus & Grafana**
- **Istio (optional)**
- **Kubernetes**

## Project Structure
- `infrastructure/` - Terraform modules for EKS, VPC, IAM, etc.
- `charts/` - Helm charts for microservices and platform components.
- `services/` - Example microservices (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- `docs/` - Documentation and diagrams.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ruslanbaba/eks-microservices-platform.git
   cd eks-microservices-platform
   ```
2. **Provision Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
3. **Deploy Microservices**
   ```bash
   cd charts
   helm install ...
   ```
4. **Configure Observability**
   - CloudWatch and Prometheus setup scripts in `infrastructure/monitoring/`

## Best Practices Implemented
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
- GitOps workflow for CI/CD
- Automated testing and security scanning
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager
